					Engineering is the use of scientific principles

					Mechanical engineering is an engineering branch that
                                        combines engineering physics and mathematics principles
                                        with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture,
                                        and maintain mechanical systems. It is one of the 
                                        oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.

                                        The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding
                                        of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics,
                                        materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In 
                                        addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use 
                                        tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided 
                                        manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to 
                                        design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment
                                        and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, 
                                        aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and 
                                        others. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design,
                                        production, and operation of machinery.

				Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is an academic program
                                at many universities which comprises scientific and engineering
                                aspects of computing. CSE is also a term often used in Europe to
                                translate the name of engineering informatics academic programs. 
                                It is offered in both Undergraduate as well Postgraduate with 
                                specializations.
                                
                                CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer
                                science such as theory of computation, numerical methods, machine
                                learning, programming theory and paradigms. Modern academic programs
                                also cover emerging computing fields like image processing, data 
                                science, robotics, bio-inspired computing, computational biology, 
                                autonomic computing and artificial intelligence.
